        <h3>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
        <p>We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area
            (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>What is GDPR?</h3>
        <p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Why GDPR is
            Important?</h3>
        <p>
            GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach.
            Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Help Scout we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and
            privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
